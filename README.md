## Enhancements for Mobile Responsiveness and Freeze Animation

### **Features Implemented:**
- Updated the code to ensure full mobile responsiveness.
- Added a **Freeze Animation** that activates when clicking the Freeze button.
- The **Freeze Button** has been designed to work seamlessly on both mobile and web.
- The **Freeze Button** includes a **Snowflake icon** for better visual representation.
- The button is now **round-shaped** for a modern and clean look.
- The animation applies **only to the card content**, not the freeze button itself.
- **Fixed positioning** of the Freeze button at the **top-right corner** of the card to keep it accessible.
- Ensured the Freeze button remains **interactive and visible after freezing the card**.

### **Interaction Details:**
- The Freeze button remains **functional at all times**, ensuring users can toggle the freeze effect.
- The card content freezes with a blur effect, while the Freeze button remains clear.
- Hover and touch effects are optimized for better user experience across all screen sizes.

These changes ensure a seamless and engaging UI while maintaining a professional look. ðŸš€
